<h2>The Empire strikes back</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>The Resistance is organizing ships to confront the Empire. They are going to reload the weapons. R2D2 has a list with the names of the ships and another one â€“ with the initial ammunition that ships with the same index carry. The droid should get a single list with the ship names and the reloaded ammunition, which should be a double value of the initial ammunition. You must code R2D2's AI to print the list that solves this problem of organizing the ships.</p><br><b>Sample Input:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">XWing-100 YWing-200 TWing-50 TIEFighter-300<br></code></pre><br><b>Sample Output:</b><br><pre><code class="language-no-highlight">[(XWing, 200), (YWing, 400), (TWing, 100), (TIEFighter, 600)]<br></code></pre><br><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
