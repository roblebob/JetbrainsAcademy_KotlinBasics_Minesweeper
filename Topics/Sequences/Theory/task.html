<h2>Sequences</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>In previous topics, we have learned how to work with collections and perform different tasks with them, such as filtering, mapping, grouping, etc.</p><p>In Kotlin, we have a special type of element containers: sequences. In this topic, we will learn how to use them. We will compare them with other collections and analyze similarities and differences.</p><h5 id="sequences">Sequences</h5><p>A sequence is a container where objects are not contained but produced while iterating. What does that mean? Those objects are not processed until it is time to use them: that is, sequences are executed lazily. We won't get an intermediate result at the end of each step. </p><p>Sequences offer the same functions as <code class="language-kotlin">Iterable</code>: we can filter, map, or order the items, but under the hood, they work differently and have a great potential for collections with large numbers of items or those requiring a lot of concatenated operations. With <code class="language-kotlin">Iterable</code>, each processing step completes and returns its result (an intermediate collection), and each step completes for the whole collection before proceeding to the next step. With a sequence, the result is calculated only when the result of the whole processing chain is requested, and all the processing steps are performed one by one for every single element.</p><p>That brings us two advantages:</p><ul><li><p>Sequences can be infinite: we can define a sequence by an initial value and an operation (for example), and that sequence will have infinite values.</p></li><li><p>They allow you to avoid intermediate steps: unlike other collections, when a sequence performs several operations (filtering, transformation, etc.), these are applied in a chain to the objects one by one, without the need to create a new collection at each step. </p></li></ul><h5 id="creating-sequences">Creating sequences</h5><p>We can create sequences in different ways.</p><p>1. From elements</p><p>We can use the <code class="language-kotlin">sequenceOf()</code> function to obtain a sequence from the elements passed as arguments:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val sequenceOfStrings = sequenceOf("one", "two", "three", "four")
val sequenceOfInts = sequenceOf(1, 2, 3, 4)</code></pre><p>2. From an <code class="language-kotlin">Iterable</code> object</p><p>Using the <code class="language-kotlin">asSequence()</code> function, we can convert any collection into a sequence:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val listOfStrings = listOf("one", "two", "three", "four")
val listOfInts = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4)

val sequenceOfStrings = listOfStrings.asSequence()
val sequenceOfInts = listOfInts.asSequence()</code></pre><p>3. From a function</p><p>We can use <code class="language-kotlin">generateSequence()</code>, which receives the first value (seed) and a function to apply to that value and constructs an infinite sequence. You may wonder why we might want an infinite sequence. We can, for example, generate values under a certain condition or simply take the elements we want from our sequence.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">// generate sequence of even numbers and take the first 5
val sequenceOfEvenNumbers = generateSequence(1) { it + 1 }
    .filter { it % 2 == 0 }
    .take(5)
println(sequenceOfEvenNumbers.toList()) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code></pre><p>4. From chunks</p><p>Using the <code class="language-kotlin">sequence()</code> method, we can produce sequence elements one by one. Thanks to <code class="language-kotlin">yield()</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">yieldAll()</code>, we can return one or more elements (<code class="language-kotlin">Iterable</code>) and suspend the execution (wait until these elements are consumed).</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val evenNumbersSequence = sequence {
    yield(2) // return 2 and suspend the function
    yieldAll(listOf(4, 6)) // return 4 and 6 and suspend the function
    yieldAll(generateSequence(8) { it + 2 }) // generate an infinite sequence of even numbers starting at 8
}
println(evenNumbersSequence.take(5).toList()) // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]</code></pre><h5 id="sequence-operations">Sequence operations</h5><p>Operations with sequences can be classified into two categories:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stateless</strong>: these operations require no state and process each element independently; they can require a small constant amount of state to process an element. Some stateless operations are <code class="language-kotlin">map()</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">filter()</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">take()</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">drop()</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Stateful</strong>: these operations require a large amount of state, usually proportional to the number of elements in the sequence. Some examples include all variants of <code class="language-kotlin">sorted()</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">distinct()</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">chunked()</code>.</p></li></ul><p>We also have two types of operations, depending on whether they generate a new sequence or already need to calculate the result:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Intermediate</strong>: when we apply the operation, the returned result is another sequence, and so you don't yet need to calculate the result from the values of the sequence, which is produced lazily. For example, <code class="language-kotlin">map()</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">filter()</code>.</p></li><li><p><strong>Terminal</strong>: it needs the values of the stream, so it will process the entire stream to get the result. Some examples are <code class="language-kotlin">toList()</code>, which returns a specific list, or <code class="language-kotlin">sum()</code>, which calculates the sum of the values in the sequence.</p></li></ul><h5 id="sequence-processing">Sequence processing</h5><p>When we work with Iterables or Sequences, it is important that we identify if we are working lazily or eagerly.</p><p>1. Iterable: eager</p><p>When we work with Iterables, we perform all operations on all the elements. That is, we work in a horizontal or eager way. It means that each and every operation is performed on each of the elements even if they are not subsequently necessary. At each step, a new collection is created. We use that when working with smaller lists or when we do not have many chained operations.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val withIterator = (1..10)
    .filter { print("Filter: $it, "); it % 2 == 0 } // filter out the odd numbers
    .map { print("Mapping: $it, "); it * 2 } // multiply the remaining numbers by 2
    .take(3) // take the first 3 numbers
println()

// Filter: 1, Filter: 2, Filter: 3, Filter: 4, Filter: 5, Filter: 6, Filter: 7, Filter: 8, Filter: 9, Filter: 10,
// Mapping: 2, Mapping: 4, Mapping: 6, Mapping: 8, Mapping: 10,
// Take: 4, Take: 8, Take: 12,

println(withIterator) // [4, 8, 12]</code></pre><p>In this example, we filtered all the elements to get only the even numbers and received a new collection with the filtered elements. Then, we map the new collection by multiplying each element by 2. Finally, we take the first 3 numbers. Therefore, we have performed a total of 10 filtering operations, 5 mapping operations, and 3 takes. That is, a total of 18 operations.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;"><tbody><tr><th><p>Operation (horizontal/eager ➡)</p></th><th><p>Values</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>init</p></td><td><p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>filter{ it % 2 == 0 }</p></td><td><p>2, 4, 6, 8, 10 (filter every element)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>map { it * 2 } </p></td><td><p>4, 8, 12, 16, 20 (map every element)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>take(3)</p></td><td><p>4, 8, 12 (take the 3 first elements)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> 2. Sequence: lazy</p><p>When we work with sequences, methods are called only when building the result list. That is, we work in a vertical or  lazy way. We perform each operation after the terminal operation has been called. The entire chain of operations on each element is processed. There are no intermediate collections involved. That is suitable for collections with many elements or where we perform many chained operations.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val withSequence = (1..10).asSequence()
    .filter { print("Filter: $it, "); it % 2 == 0 } // filter out the odd numbers
    .map { print("Mapping: $it, "); it * 2 } // multiply the remaining numbers by 2
    .take(3) // take the first 3 numbers
    .toList() // convert the sequence into a list
println()

// Filter: 1,
// Filter: 2, Mapping: 2, Take: 4
// Filter: 3, 
// Filter: 4, Mapping: 4, Take: 8
// Filter: 5,
// Filter: 6, Mapping: 6, Take: 12

println(withSequence) // [4, 8, 12]</code></pre><p>In this example, we take items element by element and perform all the operations (filter, map, and take) on each of them, one by one. Therefore, we have performed a total of 6 filtering operations, 3 mapping operations, and 3 taking operation. That is, a total of 12 operations.</p><table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" style="width: 500px;"><tbody><tr><th><p>Operation (vertical/lazy ⬇)</p></th><th><p>Values</p></th></tr><tr><td><p>init</p></td><td><p>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>filter{ it % 2 == 0 }</p></td><td><p>2, 4, 6 (filter only 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>map { it * 2 } </p></td><td><p>4, 8, 12 (map only 2, 4, and 6)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>take(3)</p></td><td><p>4, 8, 12 (take the 3 first elements)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>Sequences provide a very powerful functionality, which allows us to generate series of values and transform them, all without having to process the results until we really need them. That can help us to represent certain series of values much more easily and also to optimize the operations we perform on collections.</p><p>Now is the time to do some tasks to check what you have learned.
