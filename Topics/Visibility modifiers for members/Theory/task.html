<h2>Visibility modifiers for members</h2>
<div class="step-text">
<p>All class members—fields, methods, and properties—have visibility modifiers. Visibility modifiers allow you to set a valid scope for class members. That is, they define the context in which a given variable or method can be used. Visibility modifiers are special keywords that define which part of your code is allowed to use. There are four access modifiers in Kotlin: <strong>private</strong>, <strong>protected</strong>, <strong>internal,</strong> and <strong>public</strong>.</p><h5 id="public-members">Public members </h5><p>The <code class="language-kotlin">public</code> keyword is used to tell the compiler that something should be available to everyone. By declaring an instance of a class as a public modifier, you can refer to any of its fields anywhere in the program where the object itself is available.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">public class Student {

    public var name: String   // property is public and visible everywhere

}</code></pre><h5 id="private-members">Private members </h5><p>Meanwhile, the <code class="language-kotlin">private</code> modifier is the exact opposite of <code class="language-kotlin">public</code>. When using <code class="language-kotlin">private</code>, data will only be available within a specific class. Let's complicate the previous example by adding a private access modifier and a new variable <code class="language-kotlin">id</code>. If properties are set through the constructor, then the visibility modifier can also be specified in the constructor for the properties: </p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Student(val name: String, private val id: Int)</code></pre><p>As you can see, here <code class="language-kotlin">id</code> becomes inaccessible from the outside, since it has a private modifier:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val mark: Student = Student("Mark", 01)

println("Name: ${mark.name}  Id: ${mark.id}")  //Cannot access 'id': it is private in 'Student'</code></pre><p>To protect the fields from tampering, the <code class="language-kotlin">private</code> keyword is used—it makes the members of the class available only within the class itself. Now, these fields cannot be changed anywhere except in the methods of this class. However, you won't be able to get their value from the outside either, and an attempt to output will lead to an error.</p><p>We could use the backing property to define the getter and setter and add more control over the private fields.</p><h5 id="protected-members">Protected members </h5><p><code class="language-kotlin">protected</code> is the same as <code class="language-kotlin">private</code>, except it can be seen in subclasses. Here's an example:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">open class Person {
    protected open val name: String = ""
    private val age: Int = 0
}

class Student : Person() {
    override val age = 18 // age is private and this will NOT work
    override val name = "Eyad" // this will work
}

class Teacher {
    private val person = Person()

    fun printPerson(): String {
        return person.name // Cannot access 'name': it is protected in 'Person'
    }
}</code></pre><h5 id="internal-members">Internal members</h5><p>The <code class="language-kotlin">internal</code>  modifier means that who sees the declaring class sees its <code class="language-kotlin">internal</code> members:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Bank {
    internal val accountNumber: Long = 5L

    internal fun getBranch(): String {
        return "Branch is Alex"
    }
}

class BankController {
    private val bank = Bank()

    fun getUserAccountNumber(): Long {
        return bank.accountNumber // same module
    }
}</code></pre><h5 id="visibility-of-constructors-in-a-class">Visibility of constructors in a class</h5><p>You can also specify a modifier for constructors: for example, make the class primary constructor private. Remember to add an explicit <code class="language-kotlin">constructor</code> keyword:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Student private constructor(val name: String) {
    var age: Int = 0

    constructor(name: String, _age: Int) : this(name) {
        age = _age
    }
}</code></pre><p>In this case, the primary constructor is private, so it is accessible only from the same class (for example, when calling the secondary constructor). Accordingly, from the outside, to create an object of this class, you can use only the secondary constructor:</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val anna: Student = Student("Anna")     //Cannot access '&lt;init&gt;': it is private in 'Student'
val mark: Student = Student("Mark", 23)

println("Name: ${anna.name}  Age: ${anna.age}")
println("Name: ${mark.name}  Age: ${mark.age}")</code></pre><h5 id="public-and-private-functions">Public and private functions</h5><p>Private functions are used to hide the internal low-level logic implementation from the rest of the code and make public functions more brief and readable. Here is an example with the function <code class="language-kotlin">printInfo()</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">getAge()</code>. We have set the <code class="language-kotlin">getAge()</code> function as private, and this function is not available from the outside. Meanwhile, the <code class="language-kotlin">printInfo()</code> function is open, and we can get information about the student.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val anna = Student("Anna", 9, 19)
    anna.printInfo()
    anna.getAge()     //Cannot access 'getAge': it is private in 'Student'
}

class Student(
    private val name: String,
    private val id: Int,
    private val age: Int
) {

    fun printInfo() {
        println("Id: $id Name: $name")
    }

    private fun getAge() {
        print("Age: $age ")
    }
}</code></pre><p>Keep in mind that for local variables and functions, the visibility modifier cannot be set. Local variables and functions are available only within the function in which they are defined. We will talk about inheritance and subclasses later.</p><h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5><p>So, let's revise the names of access modifiers:</p><ul><li><p><strong>public</strong> — data is available everywhere;</p></li><li><p><strong>private</strong> — data is available only inside a class;</p></li><li><p><strong>protected</strong> — the same as private, except data can be seen in subclasses;</p></li><li><p><strong>internal</strong> -- who sees the declaring class sees its internal members.</p></li></ul>
